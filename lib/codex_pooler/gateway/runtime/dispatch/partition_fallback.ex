defmodule CodexPooler.Gateway.Runtime.Dispatch.PartitionFallback do
  @moduledoc """
  The re-selection hops of a native turn whose selected canonical partition
  cannot serve it while a held-back partition might.

  Canonical partition selection narrows a native turn to the accounts that
  advertise the model with one source shape. Selection classifies every seat
  on the quota snapshot pre-dispatch read, while route filtering, which
  classifies only the selected partition's seats, also refreshes their stale
  reset-bearing evidence and makes the Pool's refusal. Two hops close that gap,
  and each happens at most once per turn: the fallback is spent on the route
  state it builds.

  - Before dispatch (`before_dispatch/3`): route filtering refused every seat
    of the selected partition on quota. The held-back candidates go through
    the same route filtering on a route state built for them; the turn
    proceeds there when it admits one, and otherwise the refusal names both
    partitions' exclusions, so the Pool's advice and its return time cover
    the whole Pool.
  - After a refusal (`available?/1`, `context/1`, findings#206 row 206-586):
    the selected partition's last candidate refused with a provider usage
    limit before any output while a held-back candidate can serve the model
    now. The held-back candidates go through ordinary route filtering (circuits,
    quota, workspace denials, the saved-reset decisions an ordinary request
    makes, none once the request recorded a redemption) with quota and circuit
    snapshots read now, and the turn is dispatched over the resulting plan
    with the same reservation.

  Translated surfaces route over every partition and record no fallback. A
  hard pin and a file affinity leave no held-back candidate, and a
  connection-bound compaction never takes either hop: it can only run on the
  upstream connection that holds its anchor.
