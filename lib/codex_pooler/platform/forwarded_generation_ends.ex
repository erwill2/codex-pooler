defmodule CodexPooler.Platform.ForwardedGenerationEnds do
  @moduledoc """
  What the owner that served a forwarded attempt knows about the generation
  it relayed (findings#290).

  With owner forwarding a turn's executor runs on its socket's node and the
  generation on the session owner's node. When the socket's node becomes
  unreachable, the owner can end the generation itself: it cancels a turn no
  resend can rejoin, cancels a `:lost` turn at its first output, or delivers
  the terminal to a socket that reattached. After any of these the executor
  can no longer settle the attempt as a success, since no terminal reached it.
  The owner records that here, and absent-instance recovery takes the row as
  the exact evidence that the execution is over, which it otherwise gets only
  from a successor incarnation under the same node name or container slot. A
  replaced pod comes back under neither, and its orphans waited for the
  six-hour sweep.

  Only the owner that served the generation writes a row, only at those ends,
  and never for a terminal delivered to the attempt's own socket, whose
  executor may still settle it. A row is not enough on its own: recovery still
  requires the executor's instance absent past the liveness window and a
  fresh observer. Ids and times only.
