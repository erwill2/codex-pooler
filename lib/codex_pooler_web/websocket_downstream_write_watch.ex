  # Bandit writes every frame a WebSock callback pushes after the callback
  # returned and discards the write's result (`Bandit.WebSocket.Socket.send_frame/3`
  # in Bandit 1.12), so a socket cannot see that a frame it pushed never reached
  # the connection. A client that stops reading makes the kernel buffers fill,
  # the next write blocks for the 30 s send timeout and the connection is
  # closed; every later push, the terminal included, fails at once. Measured
  # (findings#232 P42): 70 of 4005 frames reached the peer and the receipt still
  # read `delivered`, so a resend of a turn the client never saw complete was
  # refused.
  #
  # ThousandIsland reports each failed write as
  # `[:thousand_island, :connection, :send_error]`, synchronously in the
  # connection process that also runs the WebSock callbacks. This handler keeps
  # the first failure of a watched connection in that process's dictionary; the
  # socket reads it back in the same process. A failed write leaves the byte
  # stream broken (a partly written frame, then a closed connection), so nothing
  # pushed from that write on can have reached the client. A successful write
  # only means the frame entered the port's driver queue, though: frames still
  # queued there when a later write times out are lost with the connection
  # (measured: one frame too many was counted). So the socket confirms its
  # evidence (`confirm/1`, at every callback entry) only while no write has
  # failed and the connection's driver queue is empty, when everything pushed
  # so far is in the kernel; after a failure the confirmed evidence is at most
  # what reached the connection, never more. Only the failure's class is kept,
  # from a fixed vocabulary, with the moment the failure was reported; the
  # frame data in the measurements is never read. That moment is when the
  # client-retry window of a turn cut by the failure starts (findings#232 row
  # 232-261): a client that stops reading without closing is noticed only
  # when a write times out, 30 s later by default, so its resend always came
  # after a window measured from the provider's completion.
  #
  # The queue can only be read while the port is open, and the port exits with
  # the peer's close: the released Codex client closes right after reading a
  # content-filter terminal (findings#303 row 303-4), so the callback that
  # confirms the terminal, and `terminate/2` itself, can run after the port is
  # gone, where `:erlang.port_info/2` answers `:undefined` and nothing would ever
  # be confirmed again. So the queue is also read right after every successful
  # write (`[:thousand_island, :connection, :send]`, in the same process) and
  # remembered: a closed port answers with that last observation, which is
  # exactly whether the latest frame was in the kernel when the client could
  # first have read it. A queue never observed counts as not empty, and so does
  # the queue of a write whose port was already gone when it was read: an
  # earlier write's observation says nothing about the latest frame.
  #
  # That reading runs after the write returned, and the client can read the
  # frame and close before it does: a socket descheduled in between finds the
  # port gone (findings#315, traced on a natural failure with Drone 1815's and
  # 1839's receipt; on loopback the client read a content-filter terminal
  # about 30 µs after its write). Such a write stays unconfirmed. The watch
  # reports it as a fact of its own (`closed_before_latest_write_read?/0`)
  # when the driver queue was read empty right before it, so the frame went to
  # the kernel directly; it cannot tell a whole write from one a full send
  # buffer cut short, and only the socket's content-filter terminal relies on
  # it.
