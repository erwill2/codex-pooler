defmodule CodexPoolerWeb.Runtime.SettlementTransactionHold do
  @moduledoc false

  # Holds the process that settles a request at a chosen point of its
  # settlement, through a `[:codex_pooler, :repo, :query]` handler that
  # matches the settling process's own statements (findings#288). The held
  # process reports `{hold, :held, pid, facts}` to the test and waits for
  # `{hold, :release}`, or releases itself after the detection budget. Only the
  # first match is held; `await_held!/1` registers the release on exit.
  #
  # `inside_transaction!/0` holds the first process that writes a turn's
  # completion inside a transaction after it inserted a settlement ledger
  # entry, right after that write: its transaction stays open and keeps every
  # row it locked, the codex session first. The settlement completes the turn
  # inside the request's own transaction, so nothing of it is visible while it
  # is held. It used to complete the turn in a second transaction, where the
  # same match holds that second transaction with the request already
  # committed.
  #
  # `after_commit!/2` holds the first process that commits a transaction in
  # which it wrote the given request's terminal status, right after that commit
  # and outside any transaction, and reports whether the same transaction wrote
  # a turn's completion. With `connection: true` the held process checks a
  # connection out first and keeps it until it is released, as a response task
  # does to publish what it settled (the interleaving of Drone 1865,
  # `OwnerCrashAfterSendScenario.kill_with_task_holding_connection!/5`).
  #
  # `after_rollback!/0` holds the first process that rolls back a transaction
  # in which it inserted a settlement ledger entry, right after that rollback
  # and outside any transaction.

  Waits until a resend's codex session lookup waits on the held settlement and

  A websocket or native HTTP resend looks its codex session up by alias and

  that lookup holding a tuple lock while it waits for the settler.
  `pg_stat_activity` pairs a live wait with the backend's status snapshot, so
