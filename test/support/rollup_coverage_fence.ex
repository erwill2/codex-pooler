defmodule CodexPooler.RollupCoverageFence do
  @moduledoc """
  Puts the committed `daily_rollup_coverages` rows back the way each sync test found them.

  PostgreSQL writes those rows, not the test: constraint triggers on `requests`, `ledger_entries`
  and `daily_rollups` (migration `20260815010747`, `mark_pool_daily_rollup_dates_mutated/1`) mark
  a date as mutated whenever a row that projects onto a date *before the database's current UTC
  day* is inserted, moved or deleted. Which day that is depends on the database clock at commit,
  so a test that commits accounting rows outside the sandbox writes a coverage row only when it
  straddles 00:00 UTC: a request admitted a few minutes before midnight and committed after it,
  or a Pool graph created before midnight whose cleanup deletes it after. The same test is clean
  at any other time of day, so no fixture can own the row by construction, and the rows it leaves
  make every later test that touches that date fail (Drone 1507: four tests red at 00:00:00 UTC).

  The fence therefore belongs to the test lifecycle, like the settings cache `DataCase` snapshots:
  `fence_test!/1` reads the committed rows when a sync test starts and registers a callback that
  runs after every cleanup of the test and after the sandbox owner stops, just before
  `CodexPooler.CommittedWriteGuard` verifies. When the rows differ, the callback deletes the
  dates the test added and writes the rows it found back exactly, `created_at` and
  `mutation_version` included. Only this table is restored: a leaked request, ledger entry or
  rollup row still fails its test through the guard, and so does a coverage row written after the
  fence ran, by a process that outlived the test.

  This restore is not a provenance check: a direct write to this table during a fenced test is
  indistinguishable from a trigger-created row with the same contents. Tests of the coverage
  mutation itself must assert it before teardown. Treating every restored date as a leak would
  reject the legitimate midnight-trigger cases this fence exists to isolate.

  The reads and writes go over a connection of the fence's own, opened by `start!/0` before the
  guard starts counting, so the fence never makes a call the guard counts. A sync test pays one
  single-table read when it starts; the closing read runs only when the test made a call the guard
  counts or had a node connected, the same condition under which the guard compares content. Two
  reads cost 0.92 ms at p50 against a 0.54 ms `SELECT 1` round trip (n=500, host load 9-24), so
  the skipped closing read keeps a test that cannot commit at one round trip. Async tests are not
  fenced; they must not commit.
