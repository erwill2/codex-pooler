  # An owner that is alive but slower than the owner call budget while a
  # native compaction asks it for an admission (findings#270 row 270-245). The
  # owner node answered every exit of an admission control as an owner already
  # gone (`owner_unavailable`), a timeout included, while a remote owner's
  # caller whose erpc deadline passed first read `owner_forward_timeout`. The
  # timeout now keeps its own cause wherever the owner runs:
  #
  #   * the socket's reservation of an incremental compaction is refused with
  #     the retryable `503 owner_unavailable` it always got, naming the timeout;
  #   * a final turn deferred behind a running turn, whose owner still does not
  #     answer at dequeue, is refused the same way on both topologies (a remote
  #     owner's stall used to run it as the ordinary turn, against that owner);
  #   * a compaction whose accounting start the owner does not answer is
  #     refused `503 owner_unavailable` with the timeout as the recorded reason
  #     (a remote owner's stall answered a non-retryable `500`).
  #
  # The same stall at a served compaction's confirmation, or at a first
  # full-history compaction's authorization or collection, no longer answers
  # `502`: the client gets the compaction the provider served and billed, and
  # the owner applies the confirmation once it answers again (findings#270 row
  # 270-249). With owner forwarding off the socket's own upstream session
  # answers those steps within a fixed one-second budget (`:direct`).
  #
  # The slow owner keeps its session, its lease and its upstream connection,
  # and serves the client's full-history resend once it answers again. The
  # real owner is suspended (`:sys.suspend/1`), or held right after an answer
  # (`OwnerCallHold`), past a one-second owner call budget, which the test sets
  # on both nodes. Owner forwarding on (off for `:direct`), native route, the
  # Pool forced to Full (a compaction needs it), the released client's
  # compaction frames, FakeUpstream. Topologies: the owner on a second VM
  # sharing the database, or on this node.
