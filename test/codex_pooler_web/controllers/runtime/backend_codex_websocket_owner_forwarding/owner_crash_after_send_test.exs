defmodule CodexPoolerWeb.Runtime.BackendCodexWebsocketOwnerForwarding.OwnerCrashAfterSendTest do
  # A session's owner ends without its `terminate/2` while it runs a turn:
  # killed (the reuse check kills an owner blocked in a callback) or crashed.
  # The turn's submission catches the owner's exit and used to hand the turn
  # to a replacement owner whenever no frame of it had arrived, so a turn whose
  # payload the provider had already received went to the provider a second
  # time on a new connection, with one succeeded attempt in the request log
  # (findings#327). The upstream session now tells the submission before the
  # payload can leave, and the submission resubmits only a turn whose payload
  # never started to leave; any other turn settles `owner_crashed` (findings#325
  # row 325-6: settle after commit, never resend). A client socket's turn is
  # never handed over at all: the socket closes `1011` on its owner's crash
  # before a replacement owner can answer, so the takeover reached nobody and
  # the client's resend sent the turn to the provider a second time, charged
  # twice (findings#328). The HTTP bridge's relay takes a replacement's frames,
  # and its turn still is.
  #
  # One node: the real public listener, owner forwarding on, the session's
  # owner and its upstream session on this node, the Pool's serving mode
  # forced to Full or Lite, FakeUpstream over a real websocket, the released
  # client's native frames or a public `/v1` SDK request. The socket and its
  # response task meet the owner's exit in the order the schedulers give, or
  # the socket is held so the task meets it first, or the task then also holds
  # a database connection while the socket handles the crash
  # (`OwnerCrashAfterSendScenario`); the peer family is
  # `remote_owner_crash_after_send_test.exs`. The `/v1` arms and that third
  # order give every process its own connection, as production does
  # (`per_process_connections?/1`).
