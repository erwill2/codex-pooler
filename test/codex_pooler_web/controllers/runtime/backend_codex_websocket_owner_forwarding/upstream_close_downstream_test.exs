defmodule CodexPoolerWeb.Runtime.BackendCodexWebsocketOwnerForwarding.UpstreamCloseDownstreamTest do
  # A `previous_response_id` resolves only on the upstream websocket connection
  # that produced it, and the provider closes that connection between two
  # requests (its connection-age limit with 1000, a restart with 1012). The
  # native socket closes its idle client with 1001 then, so the client's next
  # request goes out whole on a new socket instead of meeting
  # `previous_response_not_found` first (findings#270; the forwarding-off half
  # is `backend_codex_websocket/upstream_close_downstream_test.exs`). With
  # owner forwarding on the websocket owner holds the upstream session: it
  # tells its attached downstream, only while it holds nothing of that socket,
  # after the `:complete` of a turn whose terminal it had relayed, and the
  # socket decides on its own state as with forwarding off.
  #
  # Topology: the real public listener, owner forwarding on, the session's
  # owner on this node with its real upstream session (on a second VM sharing
  # the committed database for the remote and earlier-release arms),
  # FakeUpstream, Pools forced to Full and to Lite, the released client's turn
  # frames (turn metadata naming thread and turn), synthetic text. The client
  # drops its connection without answering the Close, as the released client
  # does.
