defmodule CodexPoolerWeb.Runtime.BackendCodexWebsocketOwnerForwarding.WindowAdvanceCutTest do
  # A turn cut on a socket whose session is keyed by an older window than the
  # one its frames carry (findings#206, P109 NEW row; icoretech/codex-pooler#429).
  #
  # The released Codex client (0.156.1) names `<thread>:<n>` in the upgrade's
  # `x-codex-window-id` and in every frame's metadata, and advances `n` after
  # every completed remote compaction. A process that compacts (after a turn,
  # or `thread/compact`) keeps its socket, so the socket's session stays keyed
  # by window n-1 while its frames carry window n. A resumed process that loses
  # the client's startup prewarm race opens its socket on window 0 while its
  # frames carry the restored window, which may already have a session of its
  # own. When a turn is cut on such a socket, the client reconnects with the
  # frames' window and resends the turn as full history; that upgrade joined
  # the other window's session, whose owner holds no replay for the turn, and
  # the resend met `owner_unavailable` at the replay preflight
  # (`public_code=duplicate_turn`) on all five websocket retries, the cut
  # request stayed behind an armed entitlement, and the client finished the
  # process over HTTPS. Measured by P109 with the released client on the
  # isolated runtime (`lite-cutfirst` 2 of 2, `full-cpu1-cut` 2 of 2).
  #
  # Frames keep the released client's key sets; identifiers, prompt text and
  # reply frames are synthetic. Owner forwarding on with the owner on this node
  # (`forwarded`) and on a second VM sharing the committed database (`peer`),
  # and owner forwarding off (`direct`). The resend is sent once the closing
  # socket armed the replay (forwarding on) or settled its turn (forwarding
  # off): the released client retries after about 200 ms and five times.
