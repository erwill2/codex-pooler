  # The client closes its socket mid-turn while the session's remote owner is
  # alive but slower than the owner call budget (findings#270 row 270-257).
  # The socket's detach times out, and the detach is still waiting for the
  # owner, which runs it once it answers again. The socket used to take the
  # timeout for an owner that is gone: its owner-lost recovery interrupted the
  # turn `owner_unavailable` under the owner.
  #
  #   * A turn that showed output: the client's resend met
  #     `409 duplicate_turn`, where an owner that answered in time lets it
  #     through.
  #   * A pre-visible turn: its replay could no longer be armed. The owner
  #     generated the turn to its end for nobody, its late success rewrote the
  #     interruption as `succeeded`, and the resend was served by a second
  #     generation.
  #
  # The socket now leaves the turn to the owner, and both end as with an owner
  # that answers in time. Owner forwarding on, native route, the Pool's
  # default serving mode, the released client's frames, FakeUpstream holding
  # the turn before its first frame (or after two). The owner runs on a
  # second VM sharing the database, booted once for the module, under a
  # one-second owner call budget set on both nodes. It stops answering until
  # the socket's cleanup gave up on it:
  #
  #   * For the turn that showed output, it is held right before the socket's
  #     detach (`OwnerCallHold`). The socket's pre-visible call before it is
  #     answered, as a live owner answers it, so only the detach waits out its
  #     budget.
  #   * For the pre-visible turn, it is suspended (`:sys.suspend/1`) before
  #     the client closes. The pre-visible call, whose late answer arms the
  #     replay, times out on its one-second budget too.
