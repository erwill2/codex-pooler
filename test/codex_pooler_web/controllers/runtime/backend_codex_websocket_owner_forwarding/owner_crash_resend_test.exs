  # settled by whichever of two finalizations reaches its rows first. The
  # socket's crash cleanup interrupts it (499, turn interrupted); the socket's
  # response task fails it with the answer it got (502, turn failed). The
  # released client closes on the socket's 1011 and resends the turn whole on
  # a new socket. Its resend was admitted only against the interrupted shape
  # and met `409 duplicate_turn` against the failed one: always after a kill,
  # whose lease takeover leaves the crash cleanup stale, and in about four
  # plain crashes out of nine (findings#270 row 270-313). Both shapes now
  # admit the resend once the proof of the attempt's executor's end exists.
  # The stale crash cleanup after a takeover stands down at info.

  # runs as in production (the test configuration turns it off).
