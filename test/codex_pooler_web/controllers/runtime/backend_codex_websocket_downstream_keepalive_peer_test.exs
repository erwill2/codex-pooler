defmodule CodexPoolerWeb.Runtime.BackendCodexWebsocketDownstreamKeepalivePeerTest do
  # The arms of `backend_codex_websocket/downstream_keepalive_test.exs`
  # (findings#302) with the session's owner and its provider connection on a
  # second VM sharing the committed database, the socket on this node. The
  # proxy's response task waits for the owner's reply to the turn submission
  # under the remote turn budget, `max(receive timeout, websocket idle timeout)
  # + 1 s`, which was a total bound: a remote turn streaming past it was
  # abandoned `owner_forward_timeout` while its frames still reached the
  # client. The budget now counts from the latest frames the socket delivered.
  # The module boots the VM once (booting it per test pushed arms past the
  # six-second budget, findings#270 row 270-323); each test starts its own
  # session's owner on it.
  #
  # Topology: the real public listener, FakeUpstream, the Pool's default mode
  # (Full), owner forwarding on, the session's owner on the peer VM. On this
  # node the downstream idle bound is 1.5 s; the long turn's arm also takes the
  # upstream receive timeout to 1 s, so its remote turn budget is 2.5 s. The
  # bound also covers the turn's setup before its first frame (the forward to
  # the peer, the owner's upstream connect), which the client's request frame
  # starts: on an idle machine the first frame comes 0.1-0.2 s after it, and up
  # to 0.5 s on the module's first turn, which still warms the peer's fresh
  # connections. A half-second bound closed the stalled arm before its first
  # frame when three suites shared the CI node (Drone 1809), and the long arm
  # before its end (Drone 1809, 1811).
