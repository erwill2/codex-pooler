defmodule CodexPoolerWeb.Runtime.BackendCodexWebsocket.StopWindowResendTest do
  # With owner forwarding off, a closing socket stops the direct task that was
  # generating its turn, then interrupts the task's request with its own reason
  # (`client_disconnected`). The kill ends the task's execution, the production
  # publisher proves that end about 100 ms later, and the interrupt is a
  # transaction of its own: a resend claimed between the proof and the
  # interrupt finds the request still in progress with its executor proven
  # dead, and its claim recovers the request as a dead execution's predecessor
  # (`FailedPredecessorResend.resolve_execution/3`). The socket used to record
  # the task's delivery receipt only after its interrupt, so nothing of what
  # the client had been shown was durable inside that window (findings#270 row
  # 270-364). It now commits the receipt between the grant of the stop and the
  # kill, and these arms pin that receipt inside the window.
  #
  # Whether the dead-execution admission refuses a resend after output the
  # client keeps is decided by findings#270 row 270-375; until then the arms
  # pin today's outcome: the resend is served as the dead execution's one
  # successor, after a completed item as before any output.
  #
  # The cleanup is held right after its interrupt's `begin`, the first
  # transaction it begins once the task is dead
  # (`CodexPoolerWeb.Runtime.CleanupProofRace.hold_interrupt_after_stop!/2`),
  # with committed rows so the resend's claim, on a new connection, reads what
  # the cleanup committed before it. One node, owner forwarding off, native
  # websocket `/backend-api/codex/responses`, the Pool's model forced to Full
  # and to Lite, FakeUpstream holding the stream at a frame barrier. Frame and
  # metadata shapes are the released client's; text and identifiers synthetic.
  # The released client's HTTPS fallback is not judged here: inside this window
  # the native HTTP chain walk steps over a predecessor still in progress and
  # serves the fallback as a new request, whatever the receipt or the proof.
