defmodule CodexPoolerWeb.Runtime.BackendCodexWebsocket.ConnectFailoverRouteHealthTest do
  # A websocket connect-phase failure fails over to the next route candidate
  # through the empty-body retry clause of the failed-websocket finalization
  # (findings#208). The failed candidate's route health is recorded there as on
  # the last candidate and on HTTP: a probe it claimed on a half-open circuit
  # resolves as a failed probe instead of staying counted in flight until the
  # staleness self-heal, and a closed circuit counts the failure (findings#325
  # row 325-4). The refusal is real (a kernel-refused loopback port) and the
  # next candidate serves the turn, on the direct path and through an owner
  # session. An upstream close after the payload was written no longer fails
  # over (row 325-6, `committed_close_settles_test.exs`).
