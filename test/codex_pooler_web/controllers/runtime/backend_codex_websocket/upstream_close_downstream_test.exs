  # requests (its connection-age limit with 1000, a service restart with 1012),
  # a client connected to it directly sees the close and sends its next
  # request whole on a new connection; behind the Pooler the client used to
  # keep its socket, anchor the next request on the closed connection's
  # response and meet `previous_response_not_found` first (findings#270). The
  # native socket now closes its idle client with 1001 once the upstream
  # connection closed, so the next request goes out whole on a new socket.

  # One node, owner forwarding off, native websocket `/backend-api/codex/responses`

  # forced to Full and to Lite, FakeUpstream, the released client's turn frames
  # (turn metadata naming thread and turn), synthetic text. The client drops
  # its connection without answering the Close, as the released client does.
