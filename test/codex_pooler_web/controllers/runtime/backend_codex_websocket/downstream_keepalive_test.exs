  # The downstream idle bound is Bandit's read timeout, which only bytes from
  # the client re-arm, and the released client sends nothing while a response
  # streams: a turn streaming longer than `websocket_idle_timeout_ms` was closed
  # in the middle (close 1002) and settled `client_disconnected` (findings#302).
  # The socket now pings the client at every third of the bound while a turn
  # delivers frames, and the client's pong re-arms the timer; a turn that stops
  # delivering gets no ping and is still closed by the bound.
  #
  # Topology: the real public listener and a Mint client, FakeUpstream pacing
  # the provider's frames on the upstream websocket, the Pool's default mode
  # (Full), owner forwarding off and on (the owner on this node). The bound is
  # one second through the test-only settings override; the behaviour is a
  # timer's, so each arm spends up to about two and a half seconds of real
  # time. The bound also covers the turn's setup before its first frame, which
  # the client's request frame starts; the peer module's half-second bound was
  # shorter than that setup on a shared CI node (Drone 1809).
