  # The released Codex client (0.159.0) stops a running turn served under Lite
  # by sending `{"type": "response.interrupt", "response_id": ..., "mode":
  # "discard_partial_items"}` on the websocket that carries the turn
  # (findings#270 row 270-272). The provider answers on that connection only:
  # `response.interrupt.accepted`, `response.output_item.interrupted` for an
  # item it had open, then the terminal `response.incomplete` with reason
  # `interrupted` and the usage generated so far; the client reads that terminal
  # as a turn ended without end-of-turn and sends its follow-up anchored on the
  # interrupted response. The Pooler refused the frame `400 invalid_request`
  # ("websocket message type is not supported"), which the client does not
  # retry, and refused the anchored follow-up `409 duplicate_turn`.
  #
  # Frames: the shape of the released client's frames and of the provider's
  # answers to a live interrupt (probe against the provider's websocket: an
  # early interrupt, right after `response.created`, is answered with no
  # `output_item.interrupted`; a late one, after the terminal, with a
  # non-terminal `response.interrupt.failed`), with synthetic text and ids.
  #
  # Topology: the real public listener, native websocket, one node with owner
  # forwarding off (the socket's own upstream session) and on (the session's
  # owner on this node), the Pool's serving mode forced to Full and to Lite
  # (the provider accepts the interrupt in both); FakeUpstream answers an
  # interrupt the way the provider does.
