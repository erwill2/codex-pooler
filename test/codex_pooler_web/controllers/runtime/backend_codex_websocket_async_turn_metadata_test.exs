  # The websocket side of findings#314 row 314-2. The released Codex client
  # fills `workspaces` in its `x-codex-turn-metadata` document from a git task
  # it starts for every turn, and nothing on the request path waits for it
  # (`turn_metadata.rs` `spawn_git_enrichment_task`; observed with a released
  # client over HTTP: the first request of a turn went out without the field
  # and the next one carried it). A websocket request's resend witness binds
  # that document (every field except `turn_id`), so a request sent before the
  # task finished and its resend sent after it differ. The resend of a turn
  # cut short must still meet the request it repeats, whether that request was
  # the turn's first on its socket (unanchored, witnessed by its replay digest)
  # or a later turn's first request, which the client sends anchored on the
  # previous turn's response (witnessed by its anchor-free tail digest) and
  # resends as full history on a new socket or over HTTPS.
  #
  # One node, owner forwarding off (the closing socket stops the turn) and on
  # (the session's owner on this node suspends a turn cut before any output
  # into a replay the resend redeems), native websocket
  # `/backend-api/codex/responses`, the Pool's serving mode forced to Full and
  # to Lite, FakeUpstream holding the cut request, the released client's frame
  # shape (turn metadata naming thread and turn in `client_metadata`),
