defmodule CodexPoolerWeb.Runtime.PartitionHeldBackQuotaRefusalTest do
  # A model whose per-account catalog sources differ in a behavioral field is
  # split into canonical partitions, and a native turn routes over the selected
  # partition only. Selection prefers the partition with the most quota-routable
  # members (`PartitionRoutability` over `CandidateEligibility.Quota.quota_routable?/4`,
  # against the one quota snapshot pre-dispatch reads), and the request's quota
  # filtering then classifies only the selected partition's seats: it refreshes
  # their stale evidence synchronously before it refuses. A held-back seat is
  # classified by selection alone, so a quota refusal of the selected
  # partition first runs the held-back seats once through the same filtering
  # (`PartitionFallback.before_dispatch/3`, codex-pooler#498): the turn moves
  # there when one is admitted, and otherwise the Pool's refusal names both
  # partitions' seats, the held-back ones marked.
  #
  # Topology: one Pool, one BEAM node, owner forwarding off unless an arm says
  # otherwise, Full serving mode, one FakeUpstream per account, the Codex
  # Desktop originator. Three "plus" assignments advertise the model with
  # `supports_experimental_context: false`; one "pro" assignment advertises it
  # with `true` and another `default_reasoning_level` (the first field is inside
  # the partition digest, the second outside it), so the model has two
  # canonical partitions: plus (3 members, oldest anchor) and pro (1 member).
  # Every plus seat is exhausted on its 5-hour account window with a distinct
  # reset; the pro seat's quota evidence varies per arm. Every seat answers the
  # provider usage read with an available 5-hour window, so a synchronous quota
  # refresh finds it routable.
