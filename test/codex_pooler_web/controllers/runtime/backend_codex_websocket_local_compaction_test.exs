  # A Codex client whose provider is not named `OpenAI` compacts locally
  # (findings#282): when the turn's context passes the auto-compaction limit
  # mid-turn, the released client (rust-v0.158.0, `core/src/compact.rs`) opens
  # a new websocket and sends its own summarization request, declared
  # `request_kind: "compaction"` with `implementation: "responses"` and the
  # turn's own `turn_id` (on the frame and in the upgrade's turn metadata),
  # then resumes the turn on its first websocket with the summary as full
  # history in the next context window. The Pooler used to read the
  # summarization request as a resend of the turn's opening request and refused
  # it `409 duplicate_turn`, six times, and the turn failed.
  #
  # From a thread's second local compaction on, in the same turn or in a later
  # one, the resume itself was refused the same way (findings#270 row 270-286):
  # a local compaction leaves no compaction item, so the resume stood no
  # further along its turn than the previous resume or the next turn's opener.
  # Its context window now stands in for the missing compaction point.
  #
  # Frames: the shape `codex exec` 0.158.0 sends with provider `name = "Codex
  # Pooler"` and `model_auto_compact_token_limit = 200` against a local fake
  # provider (field set, turn metadata, upgrade headers, input item kinds and
  # order, the Lite shape under a Lite catalog), with synthetic text and ids.
  #
  # Topology: the real public listener, native websocket, one node with owner
  # forwarding off (each socket's own upstream session) and on (the session's
  # owner on this node), the Pool's serving mode forced to Full and to Lite; a
  # second VM owning the session (forwarding on, the Pool's default mode, which
  # serves this fixture's model Full). FakeUpstream.
