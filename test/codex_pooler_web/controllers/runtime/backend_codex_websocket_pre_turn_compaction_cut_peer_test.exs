  # rows 206-310, 206-330, 206-436, 206-455), Full pre-turn and mid-turn and
  # Lite pre-turn, with owner forwarding on and the session's owner and its
  # provider connection on a second VM sharing the committed database, the
  # socket on this node, as when a production turn lands on the other web pod
  # (findings#206 row 206-334). The Lite arms commit the Pool's serving mode
  # through `model_serving_scope/0`, which removes the owner it commits
  # (findings#270 row 270-330). The module boots that VM once: booting it and
  # warming its first turn took one to three seconds of every test, and on a
  # busy machine pushed the queued arms past the six-second budget
  # (findings#206 row 206-539).
  # Each test starts its own session's owner on it and stops it when it ends.
