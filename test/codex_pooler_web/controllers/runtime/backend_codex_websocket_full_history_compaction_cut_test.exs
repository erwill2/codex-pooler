  # A NON-admitted native compaction cut before the client saw anything
  # (findings#206 row 206-333). The released client (Codex 0.156.1) sends a
  # compaction as full history on a connection that cannot resolve the
  # anchor (after any `503` refusal of the anchored one, or on a new
  # connection); when that connection is cut it resends the same full history
  # twice on new connections and then falls back to HTTPS (P69 wire probe).
  # With owner forwarding on, the owner armed the cut compaction for replay
  # like an ordinary pre-visible turn, but no resend of a compaction can
  # redeem that replay: the resend policy refuses a predecessor with a replay
  # entitlement, so both websocket resends met `409 duplicate_turn` and the
  # compaction stayed `in_progress` for more than 118 s (until the replay
  # expired), while the HTTPS fallback bought it again. The owner no longer
  # arms a compaction for replay: the cut compaction settles when its socket's
  # detach arrives and the first resend is its successor, one charge per
  # request.
  # Without forwarding the closing socket settles it within its drain. The
  # ordinary Responses turn keeps its replay (the last test). The provider
  # finishes the cut generation right after the cut; frames keep the released
  # client's key sets and identifiers, prompt text and reply frames are
  # synthetic. One node.
