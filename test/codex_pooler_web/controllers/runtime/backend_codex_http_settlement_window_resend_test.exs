defmodule CodexPoolerWeb.Runtime.BackendCodexHttpSettlementWindowResendTest do
  # The native HTTP SSE counterpart of the websocket settlement window
  # (`backend_codex_websocket/settlement_window_resend_test.exs`, findings#288).
  # A turn's settlement writes the request, its attempt, its ledger entries and
  # the turn row in one transaction; it used to complete the turn in a second
  # one, so a resend between the two commits met a terminal request behind a
  # turn still `in_progress`.
  #
  # The provider fails the turn (`response.failed` `server_error`) and the
  # settling process is held inside its settlement transaction, right after it
  # wrote the turn's completion. Nothing of the settlement is visible: the
  # request and its turn both still read `in_progress`, and the client has not
  # received the terminal either (the Pooler writes it after the settlement).
  # The client drops its connection and resends the same turn over HTTP on a new
  # one: the resend's session lookup waits on the codex session row the held
  # transaction locked (observed with `pg_blocking_pids` before the release),
  # and once the settlement commits it is served. The native HTTP turn claim
  # steps over a failed predecessor that showed no output (findings#212 row
  # 212-50), so the resend is a request of its own, not a linked successor.
  # One node, committed rows, native `POST
  # /backend-api/codex/responses` with SSE, the Pool's model forced to Full and
  # to Lite, FakeUpstream; synthetic text and identifiers.
